# Initial Concept

A lightweight, fast, and memory-safe command-line utility for displaying directory structures in a tree-like format, written in Zig.

# Product Guide

## 1. Target Audience

The primary users of this `tree` clone are power users who prefer command-line interfaces. This includes developers, system administrators, and anyone who frequently navigates and analyzes file system structures from the terminal.

## 2. Core Functionalities

The core functionality of this `tree` clone centers on providing an efficient and flexible way to visualize directory contents. Key features include:
*   Displaying directory structures in a clear, hierarchical format.
*   The ability to filter and ignore specific files and directories based on user-defined criteria, allowing for focused views of relevant content.

## 3. Key Differentiators

This `tree` clone distinguishes itself from standard `tree` implementations through:
*   **Advanced Sorting Algorithms:** It implements sophisticated sorting logic, such as prioritizing hidden files, handling case sensitivity, and organizing directories before files, to provide a more intuitive and structured output.
*   The use of Zig, focusing on memory safety and high performance, which will be a significant advantage for users working with very large or deeply nested file systems.

## 4. Design Principles

The development of this `tree` clone is guided by the following core design principles:
*   **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** The tool should be straightforward to install, configure, and operate, providing a clear and intuitive user experience despite its advanced capabilities.
*   Performance and efficiency are paramount, ensuring quick execution and minimal resource consumption.

## 5. Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision for this project is highly personal and driven by the user's continuous learning and exploration. It serves as a vehicle to:
*   **Learn a New Programming Modality:** Provide a practical and engaging platform for the user to learn and become proficient in Zig, a language distinct from their professional experience with Python, Terraform, and SQL.
*   **Experiment with Generative AI:** Offer opportunities to integrate and experiment with generative AI concepts, potentially in areas like code generation for new features, intelligent filtering suggestions, or advanced output visualizations.
*   Ultimately, the project aims to be a valuable tool for personal growth and technological exploration, while also delivering a highly functional and efficient `tree` utility.
