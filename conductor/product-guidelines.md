# Product Guidelines

## 1. Tone and Style for Documentation and Messages

The primary tone and style for all user-facing documentation and messages will be **Technical and Precise**. This emphasizes accuracy, clarity, and detailed technical descriptions, which is crucial for a developer-focused CLI tool. Documentation should be unambiguous, use precise terminology, and provide sufficient detail for users to understand the functionality and implications of each command and feature.

## 2. CLI Output Formatting and Presentation

CLI output formatting and presentation will adhere to a **Consistent and Structured** guideline. This means all output, including standard responses, warnings, and error messages, will follow a predictable format. This consistency ensures ease of parsing, improves user familiarity, and reduces cognitive load when interpreting the tool's responses. Structure should be logical, potentially using indentation, clear labels, and consistent data representations.

## 3. Error Handling and Feedback

The tool will provide feedback and handle errors through **Clear and Actionable Errors**. When an error occurs, the message will not only indicate what went wrong but also provide explicit suggestions for resolution or further debugging steps. This approach aims to minimize user frustration and accelerate troubleshooting, reinforcing the tool's utility and user-friendliness for its target audience of power users.
